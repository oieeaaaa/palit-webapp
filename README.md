# Next boilerplate

Minimal boilerplate setup for my boilerplate problems ✨

For the devs and by the dev/s ✌️

## Quick start
1. Run `yarn`
1. Run `yarn dev`
1. That's it! 🔥

## Creating a new component
1. Run `yarn component <your_component_name>`
1. Author of that component (default to author from `package.json`)
1. Component description (optional)
